# [LaTeX.CSS](https://latex.now.sh/)

> LaTeX.css is a minimal, almost class-less CSS library which makes any website look like a LaTeX document. It is based on @davidrzs' [latexCSS](https://github.com/davidrzs/latexcss).

## Getting Started

Add the following code in the head of your project.

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://latex.now.sh/style.css" />
```

Add any optional classnames to elements with special styles (author subtitle, abstract, lemmas, theorems, etc.). A list of supported class-based elements can be found [here](https://latex.now.sh/#class-based-elements).

## Contributing

Contributions, feedback and issues are welcome. Feel free to fork, comment, critique, or submit a pull request.
