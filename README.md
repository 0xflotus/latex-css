# [LaTeX CSS](https://latex.now.sh/)

> latex.css is a minimal, almost class-less CSS framework which makes any website look like a LaTeX document. It is based on davidrzs' [latexCSS](https://github.com/davidrzs/latexcss).

## Getting Started

Add the following code in the head of your project.
```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://latex.now.sh/style.css" />
```
Add any optional classnames to elements with special styles (author subtitle, lemmas, theorems, etc.). A list of supported class-based elements can be found [here](https://latex.now.sh/#cbe).

## Contributing
